Short KorGE project. Done in two weekends more for fun. Found KorGE by accident. Was wondering how one implements Game Loop with courutines. 
Googled it and found a post about KoreGE. The project is based on old Atari Game Deep Scan. Just even more primitive. Instead a ship dropping you have a static base which does the same.
